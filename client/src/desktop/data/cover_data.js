    "I've dreamed of working in the tech field for a long time! Since middle school, I've attended several hackathons like NOI, ACM, etc. These experiences gave me powerful logical thinking and a prudential work style.\n\nAfter attempting some different fields, I decided to pursue the career I love. Last year I joined an immersive program to develop full-stack applications and high traffic backend support with RESTful API. That also inspired my confidence and passion for more new challenges!",
